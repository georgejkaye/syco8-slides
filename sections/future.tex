    \frametitle{Open circuits}

    We can recover a `black-box' Mealy machine from a periodic stream function. 

    \pause

    But can we recover a circuit morphism from a `black-box' Mealy machine?

    \pause

    This is a fairly standard procedure in circuit design.

    \pause

    We need to take into account \alert{monotonicity} and \alert{signatures}.

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Conclusion}

    We have refined the \alert{categorical framework} for circuits by Ghica and Jung to eliminate \alert{instant feedback}.

    \pause

    Any closed circuit can now be reduced to a \alert{waveform} of values. 

    \pause

    The axiomatisation `agrees' with the denotational semantics of \alert{Mealy machines}.

    \pause

    We can use the \alert{final coalgebra} of Mealy machines to establish a link between \alert{closed circuits} and \alert{periodic streams}.
